:page-intro: Hervé Le Meur is a software architect and current member of the Jenkins Infrastructure team. He was introduced to the project via Jenkins-x and then moved on to work on Jenkins as part of the Infrastructure team.

Despite coming from a more analog background, Hervé got his first real taste for technology with the Amstrad CPC 464 computer.
Today, when he's not working on Jenkins tasks, Hervé likes to go for walks outside with his family, catch up on reading, and unwind watching his favorite shows.

== What is your background prior to contributing to Jenkins? 

After graduating university, I worked at a company for 10 years, but there was no CI/CD there.
I did not have an opportunity to use open-source products there, but my next job had teams using Jenkins.
I started befriending developers there, worked to become a software architect, and spent half a year integrating CD.
Through my work, I learned more about Kubernetes & CI/CD, and in doing so I contributed quite a lot to Jenkins-x, which is what we used as the CI/CD tool.
However, due to the project being in BETA, it was more complicated than I anticipated.
After being let go from this job, I reached out to link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/jstrachan/[James Strachan] and link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/jrawlings/[James Rawlings], who then gave me a link to a job opening from link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/[Oleg Nenashev] at CloudBees for the role that I am currently in.

In my head I was a programmer, not a sysadmin.
So when link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markewaite/[Mark Waite] was interviewing me and asked me some network questions, this was a bit daunting and seemed potentially impossible.
However, I had an interview with Mark, link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/dduportal/[Damien Duportal], and link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/olblak/[Olivier Vernin] that was a fantastic experience.
We were able to have a meaningful discussion that helped me feel more comfortable, and made my decision easier.
15 minutes before my interview, I got a final offer from another company (where Damien & link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/jmmeessen/[Jean-Marc Meessen] had previously worked), hesitated and it turned out for the best since I'm still part of the Jenkins project today.
I also had experience moderating an online forum, so the community part of the role was familiar to me.

== How long have you been using Jenkins?

I started with Jenkins-x but had never touched Jenkins proper.
My initial impression of Jenkins was not positive, thinking it was due to how bad and unstable it was.
However, once I started using Jenkins, it was the comparrison was night and day.
My first impression was that it was heavy & slow compared to others.
I was not alone in thinking that Jenkins is not necessarily the best, fastest, or newest project, but was proven wrong once I started working on the project.

== Why choose Jenkins over other projects?

I didn't necessarily choose Jenkins as much as it is the main part of my job.
As part of my role, I've spent time looking at what Olivier, Damien & Mark have put in place for infrastructure.
Jenkins is much more improved and efficient, with complete integration from server to image delivery, we have control and segmentation over every aspect.
I love the fact that we are using Jenkins to develop and distribute Jenkins.
This is unique because most open-source tools don't have transference success, where Jenkins has spent so much time and effort building to work with developer processes and functionalities.
In my eyes, this is one of the main aspects of why Jenkins is successful.
Jenkins has also integrated other tools, such as Terraform, Puppet, academage, and M-Files with Jenkins, but Jenkins is the main orchestrator of these.
Other projects and tools do not own their issues, but Jenkins owns, and works on its issues, in order to improve.
I've always liked creating and working on tools, so working on Jenkins is a crowning achievement for me, even if it's not core.

== What growth have you seen in Jenkins since joining the project?

We have been getting more and more instances defined as code, this means that they do not have to go in and configure settings manually since the code is pre-defined.
We are also slowly progressing to have ci.jenkins.io to being defined and managed as code.
Currently, there are some small areas in Jenkins infrastructure using this. 

== Is there an aspect of Jenkins that you're particularly passionate about?

Right now, I'm having fun with refactoring Windows build process, using the docker controller on the agent image.
I like working on the contributor side as well, because it's like a puzzle and knowing what I need to get to and where I'm starting from makes it much more enjoyable..

== What sort of contributions have felt the most successful or impactful?

link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/basil/[Basil Crow] proposed an interesting idea to use SQLite instead of a file system, which is very interesting.
However, this idea is competing with other proposals.
The switch to JDK 17 has been very successful and with the availability of JDK 21, Jenkins is running on newer platforms and keeping up with progress to stay current.
Plugin health score identification has also been great for the visualization of overall plugin ecosystem health.

== Advice for new developers and new members of the open-source community
One of the first things that I was warned about was the vastness of the project, and was instructed to choose one thing to focus on at first.
Don't hesitate to try it out, open source means that it is open to all.
Don't be afraid to open a pull request, it does not need to be perfect.
You might end up liking it and continue to submit contributions!
