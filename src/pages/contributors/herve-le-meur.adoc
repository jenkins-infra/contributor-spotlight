:page-intro: Hervé Le Meur is a site reliability engineer and current member of the Jenkins Infrastructure team. He was introduced to the open-source community via Jenkins X and then moved on to work on Jenkins infrastructure.

Hervé comes from a more analog background, with his father being a carpenter and his mother being an upholsterer, but got his first real taste for technology with the Amstrad CPC 464 computer at the age of six.
Today, when he's not working on Jenkins tasks, Hervé likes to go for walks outside with his family, catch up on reading, and unwind watching his favorite shows.

== What is your background prior to contributing to Jenkins? 

After graduating from university, I worked at a small B2B marketing consultancy company for 10 years as a jack of all trades developing the tools we used, but there was no CI/CD nor open source there.
After that, I went into a building information modeling (BIM) software company, starting as a software developer.
Some teams were using Jenkins, but it seemed cumbersome and slow for them at the time.
As I grew into the role of software architect, I was tasked with setting up a new CI/CD based on Jenkins X, which took me several trimesters.
As Jenkins X was fresh from the oven and as I was new to Kubernetes, this was a much more difficult task than anticipated, especially since the passage of Jenkins X to beta, making me redo most of what I put in place several times.
Through this work, I learned a lot about Kubernetes & CI/CD, and in doing so I contributed quite a lot to Jenkins X.
These were my first contributions to the open-source world.
After being let go from this job, I reached out to link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/jstrachan/[James Strachan] and link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/jrawlings/[James Rawlings], who then gave me a link to a job opening from link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/[Oleg Nenashev] at CloudBees for the role that I am currently in.

In my head, I was a programmer, not a sysadmin.
So, when link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markewaite/[Mark Waite] explained that the last round of interviews would be about networking, this was a bit daunting.
I thought my opportunity would be lost because of this since it felt potentially impossible.
However, when the time for my interview came with Mark, link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/dduportal/[Damien Duportal], and link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/olblak/[Olivier Vernin], they asked me how I integrated the CI/CD with Jenkins X instead: that was a fantastic experience.
We were able to have a meaningful discussion that helped me feel more comfortable and made my decision easier.
15 minutes before my interview, I got a final offer from another company (where Damien & link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/jmmeessen/[Jean-Marc Meessen] had coincidentally previously worked) and hesitated, but it turned out for the best since I'm still part of the Jenkins project today in what I could call a dream job.
I also had experience moderating an online forum, so the community part of the role was familiar to me.

== How long have you been using Jenkins?

I started with Jenkins X but had never touched Jenkins proper.
Apart from sharing the Jenkins name, they have nothing in common.
My preconceptions of Jenkins were negative.
I thought it was an unwieldy, outdated, and complicated Java program.
These impressions manifested from what I had heard from others dealing with it in my previous company.
However, once I started using Jenkins, the comparison was night and day.
My preconception was that it was heavy & slow compared to others.
I was not alone in thinking that Jenkins is not necessarily the best, fastest, or newest project, but I was proven wrong once I started working on the project.

== Why choose Jenkins over other projects?

I didn't necessarily choose Jenkins as much as it is the main part of my job.
As soon as I started reviewing what Tyler, Olivier, Damien, and Mark have put in place for Jenkins infrastructure, I realized that Jenkins is much more improved and efficient than I thought.
I also love the fact that we are using Jenkins to develop and distribute Jenkins.
This usage is unique because most open-source tools don't have transitive success.
Jenkins has spent so much time and effort building to work with developer processes and functionalities.
In my eyes, this is one of the main aspects of why Jenkins is successful.
Jenkins has also integrated other tools, such as Terraform and Puppet, but Jenkins remains the orchestrator of these.
Jenkins has also integrated other tools, such as Terraform, Puppet, Kubernetes, and Helmfile amongst others, but Jenkins remains the orchestrator of these.
Working on Jenkins is a crowning achievement for me, since I've always liked creating and working on tools, even if I'm not working on the core of Jenkins.

== What growth have you seen in Jenkins since joining the project?

We have been getting more and more instances defined as code.
As a result, we can recreate any of our instances without having to configure settings manually, vastly increasing our resilience.
We are also slowly progressing to the point where ci.jenkins.io is defined and managed as code.

== Is there an aspect of Jenkins that you're particularly passionate about?

Right now, I'm having fun refactoring the build process of the official Docker images for Jenkins controllers and agents.
I also like working on the contributor side because it's like a puzzle, and knowing what I need to get to and where I'm starting from makes it much more enjoyable.

== What sort of contributions have felt the most successful or impactful?

link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/basil/[Basil Crow] proposed an interesting idea to use SQLite instead of a file system.
The switch to JDK 17 has been very successful, and with the availability of JDK 21, Jenkins is running on newer platforms and keeping up with progress to stay current.
As we like to keep the Jenkins infrastructure on the edge (such as always running the last Jenkins Weekly), the next step is introducing JDK22.
Plugin health score identification has been great for visualizing the overall plugin ecosystem health.

== Advice for new developers and new members of the open-source community
One of the first things I was warned about was the vastness of the project and was instructed to choose one thing to focus on at first.
Don't hesitate to try it out; open source means that it is open to all.
Don't be afraid to open a pull request; it does not need to be perfect.
You might end up liking it and continue to submit contributions!
