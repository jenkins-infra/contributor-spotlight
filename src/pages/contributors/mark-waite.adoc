:page-intro: Mark Waite is a father of eight, grandfather of 13, Jenkins Governance board member, Jenkins core maintainer, and the maintainer of several plugins. This is the long way of saying Mark wears many hats. However, his passion for open source and Jenkins is clear through all of his work and contributions to the Jenkins project.

Mark loves to travel with his wife to visit and spend time with their children, who live in fun and interesting parts of the United States, including Alaska, Texas, California, and Colorado.
His travels also include two years he spent in northern Italy beginning at age 19.
Mark and his wife still maintain several friendships he first made during those two years in Italy.
Whether at home or traveling, Mark enjoys recreational cycling and wandering with his wife.

== What is your background prior to contributing to Jenkins?

I graduated from university with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.
During the interview process, while preparing for my first job after graduating, I told the interviewer that I didn't want to be a mechanical engineer and that I wanted to play with computers for the rest of my life.
That interviewer was seeking people to create a mechanical engineering software business inside Hewlett-Packard.
I was one of their support engineers for the first several years.

After spending enough time as a support engineer, I asked if I could become a programmer.
They were bold enough to allow me to become a programmer.
However, after some years of programming, I realized I was not a great programmer but a good organizer.
I decided to switch to release management and then to managing a development team.

In late 2002 or early 2003, my team learned about Extreme Programming, a methodology that encourages all production code to be written by two programmers paired together.
Extreme Programming requires continuous integration.
We set our goal to have "XP by 3/03" and started to create our own CI server.

In 2007 or 2008, I switched to a new company with a new project and discovered the continuous integration server that became Jenkins.
I was impressed at how easy it was to deploy and manage and how well it worked.

A few companies after that, I joined CloudBees to work full-time on helping Jenkins grow.

== How long have you been using Jenkins?

I started using Jenkins in 2007 or 2008.
I've been using it since then, even during the times when I worked for employers that chose another continuous integration solution.

== Why choose Jenkins over other projects?

Jenkins was easy to configure and easy to manage, especially compared to its competitors at the time.
I defined jobs, modified configurations, and viewed test results from a web browser.
I often found that the flexibility of Jenkins was more important to me than the specific reasons that an employer had chosen another solution.
I had problems to solve and Jenkins solved those problems.

== What problems has Jenkins solved for you?

Jenkins builds my code, runs my tests, and shows the results across a wide range of systems and technologies.

== Is there an aspect of Jenkins that you're particularly passionate about?

I have been involved in each area of Jenkins at some point, but I'm proud of the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/[Git] and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client/[Git client] plugins that I maintain.
I'm also involved in the platforms and documentation SIGs, where I host the later Jenkins documentation office hours.

== What sort of contributions have felt the most successful or impactful?

The link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/[Improve a plugin tutorial] and the link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan/[2+2+2 Java Support Plan] have both felt like impactful and successful contributions. 
In each case, they were important to a wide group of people and they were important for an extended period of time.

== Advice for new developers and new members of the open-source community

Do not in believe self-imposed barriers to open source contribution.
I mistakenly thought that a mere mortal, such as myself, could not possibly be of use to a successful and impressive project like Jenkins.
I was wrong.
Mere mortals are _exactly_ the type of people who do _amazing_ work in the Jenkins project.
Find a topic that interests you, either professionally or personally.
Find areas in the Jenkins project that are involved in that area of interest.
Contribute your skills and your passion in that area.
Help others do the same.

I was interested in test automation, so I wrote automated tests for the Jenkins Git plugin.
As a result, I learned much more about Git, Java, and test automation.

I was interested in Git performance, so I experimented with options to improve Git performance.
Through this, I learned more about Git and performance.

I was interested in operating systems and platforms, so I experimented with uncommon processors and operating systems.
I learned more about operating systems, file systems, and their interactions.
