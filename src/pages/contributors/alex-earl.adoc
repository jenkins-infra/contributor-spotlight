:page-intro: Alex Earl is a software engineer from Chandler, Arizona. He has been using and contributing to Jenkins for the last 15 years, during which he has provided numerous enhancements and changes.

When not pursuing his open-source work, Alex loves spending time with his family, working on tech puzzles, and helping others in any way that he can.

== What is your background prior to contributing to Jenkins?

I was doing C++ and Visual Basic at work, along with a little bit of embedded C development.
I transitioned to C# from C++/VB in the application I was supporting, and started to pick up more responsibility in the build and deployment area of my group.
I started using Jenkins to do the build/deployment and moved my group in a much more agile direction, using continuous integration for our testing.
This led to me looking at the plugin:email-ext[Email Extension] plugin and trying to understand why it wasn't able to do what I wanted it to do.
I started submitting patches and fixing issues in the plugin to help me in my work.
The rest, as they say, is history!

== How long have you been using Jenkins?

I have been using Jenkins for the last 15 years.

== Why choose Jenkins over other projects?

Jenkins was, and still is, the best at what it does.

== What problems has Jenkins solved for you?

Jenkins has helped solve lots of problems!
I had to build and deploy around 50 embedded firmware binaries, several desktop applications, and more.
Jenkins has helped me streamline this and make solutions that are easy to use, easy to maintain, and powerful!

== Is there an aspect of Jenkins that you're particularly passionate about?

I like to help people resolve issues on the Community channels (link:https://community.jenkins.io/[community.jenkins.io] and link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_jenkins:gitter.im[Matrix]).
Due to the global reach of Jenkins and the Community channels, we are able to communicate easily and help each other.
Interacting with people all over the world, learning from them, and helping them solve issues is part of the magical open-source experience.

== What sort of contributions have felt the most successful or impactful?

I have previously maintained and currently maintain plugins that are used by _many_ people.
It feels good to make an impact by working on something that so many people use.

== Advice for new developers and new members of the open-source community

Just find something that you like (or I guess don't like and want to improve) and go for it.
There are plenty of issues in Jira and GitHub that need someone to look at them!
